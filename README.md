# Flutter Gemini

Repository to test GEMINI using Flutter.

I followed this [tutorial](https://medium.com/google-developer-experts/chatbot-with-multimodality-features-using-flutter-and-gemini-13ea8ff7d55f#4460) by Esther Irawati Setiawan. But I tried to change so I can learn more.

I am using `.env` file to keep the API Key.
